<p><strong>Experienced office and warehouse manager with a focus on improving workflow efficiency by leveraging automation and digital solutions.</strong></p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Jessika Parman</strong> is an experienced office and warehouse manager with a focus on improving workflow efficiency. Having learned the ropes of office management in high school while working in her mother's store after classes, Jessika understands what it takes to <em>think like an owner</em> as opposed to simply <em>being an employee</em>.</p>
<p>Jessika understands how modern technology can streamline the efficiency of the workplace. She implicitly understands the pitfalls of “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeslacouncil/2019/01/28/the-most-dangerous-phrase-in-business-weve-always-done-it-this-way/#17f3747c40f7">We've always done it this way</a>” and has a sixth sense about how to streamline operations. Jessika understands that the best way to move things forward is to first listen and understand how things work before suggesting solutions which may not fit. But by letting computers do what computers are good at, we can free up the staff to focus on what <em>humans</em> are good at.</p>
<p>With experience being forklift-certified, to understanding customer relationship management (CRM) software, to designing inventory control processes, Jessika is truly a <em>Jill-of-all-trades</em>. She is intrinsically motivated, thinks like an owner, delivers on commitments, and always desires to deliver the best possible experience for customers. Outside of work, Jessika lives north of Seattle with her husband, two high-school aged children, and three dogs. She is a ranked player in the <a href="https://poolplayers.com">American Poolplayers Association</a>, and is working on getting her personal training certification in physical fitness.</p>

<h4 id="office-manager-november-2018january-2019">Office Manager (November 2018–January 2019)</h4>
<p>My job was to keep the office organized and running for a husband &amp; wife who had purchased the business and were brand-new to this industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Was (metaphorically) thrown into a burning building. Managed both the office as well as the production floor. Managed 15 employees, some of whom only spoke spanish. Listened and learned about the needs of the floor workers. Worked with powder companies to become knowledgable enough in the products to be able to train. Scheduled training seminars to perform demos and teach techniques.</p></li>
<li><p>There was a fire shortly after I started which shut down production. Coordinated the ordering, delivery, and pickup of replacement parts; followed-up with the fire department to schedule inspections to ensure we were up-to-code, had appropriate safety equipment, etc. Production fell behind and the owners were unavailable, I took the initiative to step-in and ensure work got done, assigned tasks, performed quality control and training on-the-fly. Met deadlines in a "powder keg" environment, and was able to handle the stress of the production floor.</p></li>
<li><p>Owner was performing door-to-door sales and avoiding the CRM. Took over responsibilities for customer callbacks, qualifying customers and pre-sales leads. Managed the in-house ordering system, the order forms/processes, invoicing, and account reconciliation. Inventory was performed for the first time in 10 years.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned that without capable management, the business will not succeed. Employees look up to the people in charge. They know what's going on. Honest conversations with the team and operating with transparency and without ego is key to happy/trusting teams.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="office-manager-february-2017november-2018">Office Manager (February 2017–November 2018)</h4>
<p>Made a name for myself by being a utility player that was able to fill all roles (e.g., office, warehouse, vendor management, event coordination). Was also the owner's personal assistant.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Worked with the owner to adopt the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">Lean</a> methodology (including <a href="https://www.processexcellencenetwork.com/lean-six-sigma-business-performance/articles/what-is-kanban">Kanban</a>) to eliminate waste and increase organization and efficiency. Adapted my approach to inventory management to align with <em>Lean</em> principles. Performed the intitial inventory of all items, and designed a process to keep track of where inventory was used. Optimized the re-order workflow to ensure that we never ran out of materials unexpectedly. With a second rented warehouse, there was more inventory and management that was required across multiple locations. Negotiated with vendors for better pricing.</p></li>
<li><p>Worked with logistics companies to ensure on-time deliveries for all work materials; incoming inventory management; quality control to ensure customer satisfaction; nearly all materials were project-specific. Worked to ensure that we always had the correct materials on-hand for the installation jobs, and that we had as little money as possible tied-up in unsellable inventory. Posted ads on Facebook and Craiglist for any scrap materials left over from installations. Was responsible for operating the turf cutter so that we could cut-to-spec.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved sales with vendor events. Performed cost analysis, booth design and supplies, and scheduling the team and equipment to operate the booth. Events cost an average of $2,500-5,000, ran for 3-5 days, 8-12 hours per day, with 1-2 people operaring the booth; out of 50 leads, roughly 10-15 were qualified leads that converted into sales. Each job was a minimum of $5,000, and the owner wanted to make back a minimum of 2.5× his event investment. For each sale, I would up-sell additional products and services.</p></li>
<li><p>Completed a full CRM implementation. This required a full understanding for how the business worked. Managed the sales funnel from the website, and engaged with customers to qualify the leads. Aligned with owner's vision for a tangible solution with online leads, filter of hot/cold leads, and setting-up consultation appointments.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer "touchpoints" refer to every single point where a customer interacts with your company/brand. By focusing on those touchpoints, and making each of those distinct experiences positive ones for the customer, it makes a huge difference in the quality of customer relationships and the trust they have in you. Example touchpoints are: When we're responding over email/Twitter/Facebook, greeting them when we meet them, answering their questions, in the time it takes to follow-up, in how we support them on the long-tail of the sales cycle, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Experienced and participated in "360-degree" performance reviews. These included a self-review, a review of your manager, and a review of your peers. Others would do the same, ensuring that the review feedback was well-rounded and multi-directional. Everybody has areas where they can improve, and this was a great way to learn about growth opportunities in a company that encouraged growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned that Kanban doesn't work if there's no accountability/reinforcement; learned the importance of a good workflow; learned the value of self-reflection and understanding your personal strengths/weaknesses; learned that team morale is critical (e.g., team outings); learned the value of earning the trust of your peers (e.g., we all rise and fall together).</p></li>
<li><p>Learned about the recruiting, interviewing, hiring, and training processes. Learned as much about making the right decisions as about avoiding the wrong decisions. Made some mistakes in retrospect, but learned from them so that the next time would be more effective.</p></li>

<p>My job was to keep the office organized and running for a husband &amp; wife-managed business.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discovered an interest in inventory management; started the process of organizing the inventory on-hand; developed processes for not running out of stock, and keeping track of inventory as it was pulled.</p></li>
<li><p>The owners had an approach to running their business that was incompatible with my personal ethics. Chose to leave after a few months to explore other opportunities.</p></li>

<h4 id="office-and-warehouse-manager-november-2016december-2016">Office and Warehouse Manager (November 2016–December 2016)</h4>
<p>I had just moved to the state, and was looking for a job to supplement my income while my fledgling business was still new and unstable. Coming from a warehouse background, I natually gravitated to a team like CFM.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The store was brand-new and I helped with the store's opening: I designed and set up the warehouse layout and organization; handled all of the loading and unloading of new product from the trucks; started learning the CRM tooling.</p></li>
<li><p>Even though the job didn't work out as well as I'd hoped for, there were some important lessons I learned from this experience: I wasn't prepared for the hour-long commute at 6am into Seattle; learned the importance of getting all verbal agreements in writing; learned the importance of honoring your verbal commitments.</p></li>

<h4 id="owner-direct-sales-july-2016january-2019">Owner, Direct Sales (July 2016–January 2019)</h4>
<p>Opened an online retail clothing store for the first time. Even though the business ended up being a failure, I was able to gain insight and experience as a result that is difficult to learn in other contexts.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vetted and brought-on vendors; vetted and tested products before selling them; learned the value of building trust with customer relationships; learned how to run a small business end-to-end; learned how to separate personal finances from business funds.</p></li>
<li><p>Explored a variety of approaches to marketing and social media presence via trial and error; managed multiple social media channels with automation; kept customers engaged via email marketing, trade show and vendor events, and Facebook Live video streaming.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned about the cyclical nature of online sales; adapted inventory control to keep the right amount of the right products on-hand, and reduced the off-season products to free-up cash to reinvest; adapted to identifying product 2–3 seasons ahead; over a long enough timeline, was able to see trends about what sells best during different parts of the year. Learned how to analyze sales numbers to understand costs, revenue, and profits.</p></li>
<li><p>Learned humility by discovering several approaches that don't work; learned how to manage and prioritize time while balancing the needs of the business, family, and myself; learned not to employ your friends; persevered when the work got hard and managed to build a business with decent revenue for its size; at the same time, understanding the sales projections helped me understand when it became the right time to close shop. (You need to know when to quit so that you can shift your efforts to something more effective.)</p></li>
<li><p>When you have a product you're passionate about, it's easy and fun to sell; I learned a lot from the many new people I met as a result; gained many personal and professional contacts/connections; the business opened doors to modeling and fitness opportunities.</p></li>
