**Experienced office manager with a focus on improving efficiency by embracing technology.**

## Summary/Objective

Jessika is not _yet-another-cog-in-the-machine_. She is a leader who brings new ideas to the table, challenges the status quo, and seeks to make every working environment better. Conversely, if you're looking for someone to sit, do precisely the thing, and then stop and wait for futher instructions — this probably won't be a good fit for anyone.

Jessika is truly a _Jill-of-all-trades_. Her strength comes from not being trapped in the box of having one, specific, narrowly-defined role. Instead, being _encouraged_ to bring business value, efficiency, and improvements _across_ the business is a role where Jessika will thrive. She is looking for a role where creative problem-solving is encouraged, not frowned-upon. She seeks to work with a team that _wants_ to improve, _wants_ to grow, and is receptive to new ideas. She is intrinsically motivated, thinks like an owner, delivers on commitments, and always desires to deliver the best possible experience for customers. She isn’t constrained by [how things have always been done][always-done].

Outside of work, Jessika lives in northern Colorado with her husband, two children, and three dogs. She loves travel and is an amateur photographer.

### [Mountain West](https://mountainwest.us) — Fort Collins, CO

#### Business Operations Manager (January 2024–June 2024)

* Led the effort to adopt a CRM system, including helping the business select the appropriate CRM, managed setup and onboarding, and performed staff training. Previously, invoicing was primarily performed by hand, on paper.

* Documented systems and procedures for the office for the first time. Worked to define the workflow and document it, providing clarity and reducing confusion.

* Collected daily activity logs from field workers, imported information into a spreadsheet, then used that spreadsheet to generate weekly profit-and-loss reports.

* Coordinated between the city and our customers for dust control and snow removal matters.

* Produced a standardized safety manual for our company, modeled after multiple safety manuals from other companies that had been collected.

### [Graff’s Turf](https://graffsturf.com) — Fort Morgan, CO

#### Office Operations and Leadership (March 2022–January 2023)

* One of our goals was to stabilize the core of the business, with a goal to grow from 2 stores to 50 stores over the next several years. Most of my work was driven by this premise.

* Rebooted the interview process with a much higher focus on identifying candidates with greater competency, who _think like an owner_, and have a bias toward taking action.

* Began the process of documenting our company processes and procedures for the first time in the company’s 50-year existence. This allowed us to bring more rigor and repeatability to tasks, cross-train the team on how to perform tasks, and speed-up new hire onboarding.

* Established weekly meetings between between the staff and leadership, to increase transparency and improved communication throughout the organization.

* Coordinated between leadership and the installation crew. This involved communicating between different roles in the organization, managing expectations, encouraging people to grow beyond their comfort zones, and ensuring that the change in process was successful.

* Adopted _Google Workspaces_, allowing sales reps and other off-site workers to share information without being tied to a desk. Responsible for all documentation and training of all staff.

* Helped select and establish a CRM with better integration into our other systems, reducing manual work. Took the initiative to dive deeply so that I could document the tasks and train the rest of the team.

* Stepped-up our web and social media presence. Took over social media posts for about 6 weeks to set the tone and guide the work, before handing-off to a marketing firm. During those 6 weeks we saw a 375% increase in posts, 106% increase in visits to our Facebook page, and a 48.5% increase in page likes.

* Developed the sample package that is now used for maintenance plans on synthetic turf. Maintenance plans are now an integral part of upselling as a way to drive additional revenue.

### Red Moon Resale — Online

#### Owner, Reseller (May 2021–March 2022)

_Red Moon Resale_ was a re-seller of apparel and accessories. As a _one-woman-show_, Jessika was involved in every aspect of the business.

### [Bark King Blower Truck Service](https://barkking.com) — Woodinville, WA

#### Office Manager (January 2019—April 2021)

* Improved the interview process to have fewer false-positives. Adopted revisions to the employee manual, insurance manuals, and training guides. Collaborated with the HR company to ensure legal compliance.

* Saved money through price comparisons and negotiating with vendors over prices.

* There was active resistance to digital solutions and modernization of business practices. While many of these were unimplemented, Jessika proposed meaningful improvements to productivity by:

  * Moving the job schedules into a shared, digital calendar that was reviewable by everyone.
  * Moving documents and spreadsheets into a modern office-document solution like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365.
  * Speeding up the ability to pay by migrating from paper invoices being snail-mailed to customers, over to web-based invoicing.
  * Adopting a CRM would have made it easier to divide the work and respond to customer requests in a more timely manner.
  * Migrating from hand-written orders to computer-based entry.

* Learned that transparent communication with employees is vital; paying attention to customer touchpoints makes a huge difference; poor customer communication and a lack of timeliness leads to lost business and customer distrust; better delegation can make an office more efficient; learned that an inability to adapt, and micromanagement, will actively prevent the success of your business.

### [Thermo Tech Coatings](http://www.thermotechcoatings.com) — Monroe, WA

#### Office Manager (November 2018–January 2019)

### [Synthetic Turf Northwest](https://www.syntheticturfnorthwest.com) — Monroe, WA

#### Office Manager (February 2017–November 2018)

* Performed the intitial inventory of all items and designed a process to keep track of where inventory was used. Optimized the re-order workflow. Inventory management was required across multiple locations. Negotiated with vendors for better pricing.

* Worked with logistics companies to ensure on-time deliveries; performed quality control to ensure customer satisfaction. Ensured that the team always had the correct materials on-hand for jobs, and avoided tying-up unsellable inventory. Sold leftover scrap materials online.

* Vendor events: Performed cost analysis, booth design and supplies, and scheduling the booth team/equipment. A $2,500-5,000 event generated 50 leads (avg). Roughly 20 were qualified leads @ $5,000+ per job (= $100,000 at the low end). Up-sold additional products and services.

* Completed a full CRM implementation. Managed the sales funnel from the website, and engaged with customers to qualify the leads. Aligned with owner's vision for online leads, filter of hot/cold leads, and setting-up consultation appointments.

### Blazing Gypsy Boutique — Online

#### Owner, Direct Sales (July 2016–January 2019)

Jessika opened an online retail clothing store for the first time. Even though the business ultimately failed, she was able to gain insight and experience as a result that is difficult to learn in other contexts.

When you have a product you're passionate about, it's easy and fun to sell; Jessika learned a lot from the many new people she met as a result; gained many personal and professional contacts/connections; the business opened doors to other opportunities.
