**Experienced office and warehouse manager with a focus on improving workflow efficiency by leveraging automation and digital solutions.**

## Summary

**Jessika Parman** is an experienced office and warehouse manager with a focus on improving workflow efficiency. Having learned the ropes of office management in high school while working in her mother's store after classes, Jessika understands what it takes to _think like an owner_ as opposed to simply _being an employee_.

Jessika understands how modern technology can streamline the efficiency of the workplace. She implicitly understands the pitfalls of “[We've always done it this way][always-done]” and has a sixth sense about how to streamline operations. Jessika understands that the best way to move things forward is to first listen and understand how things work before suggesting solutions which may not fit. But by letting computers do what computers are good at, we can free up the staff to focus on what _humans_ are good at.

With experience being forklift-certified, to understanding customer relationship management (CRM) software, to designing inventory control processes, Jessika is truly a _Jill-of-all-trades_. She is intrinsically motivated, thinks like an owner, delivers on commitments, and always desires to deliver the best possible experience for customers. Outside of work, Jessika lives north of Seattle with her husband, two high-school aged children, and three dogs. She is a ranked player in the [American Poolplayers Association](https://poolplayers.com), and is working on getting her personal training certification in physical fitness.
