**Experienced office and warehouse manager with a focus on improving workflow efficiency by leveraging automation and digital solutions.**

## Summary

* Works to make businesses more efficient. Looks for inefficiencies in how things are done.

* Teaches how to adopt social media and branding.

* How do I say: yes do thngs, but then take a step firther to create documents and processes. Push forward to next steps.

* Ideas become too much for mom and pop shops.

* Learn the way they want to do things, then present more efficient ways to grow the business.

* Biz outreach. Vendor events. Ideas around how to reach customers.

* Highly creative. Explosive with ideas.

* Not wanting typical customer-facing 9-5. Work behind the scenes to make the business better and draw more customers. Prefer full remote, vacation time, and being treated like an adult.

* Don;t want to be trapped in the box of having one, specific, narrowly-defined role. Want to be able to bring improvements to all areas of the biz.

* Looking for a role where creative problem solving is encoutaged, not frowned upon.

* Jessika understands what it takes to _think like an owner_.

* Jessika understands how modern technology can streamline the efficiency of the workplace. She implicitly understands the pitfalls of “[We've always done it this way][always-done]” and has a sixth sense about how to streamline ????.

* Jessika understands that the best way to move things forward is to first listen and understand how things work before suggesting solutions which may not fit. But by letting computers do what computers are good at, we can free up the staff to focus on what _humans_ are good at.

* Jessika is truly a _Jill-of-all-trades_. She is intrinsically motivated, thinks like an owner, delivers on commitments, and always desires to deliver the best possible experience for customers.

* Outside of work, Jessika lives in northern Colorado with her husband, two children, and three dogs. She is a ranked player in the [American Poolplayers Association](https://poolplayers.com), and is an avid hiker and amateur photographer.

* Looking to pivot career from Office Management into creative work.

## Work Experience & Notable Projects

* Creating YouTube content.
* Nature/travel photography.
* Creative endeavors.
* Logos
* Business branding
* Fliers/templates
* Umbrella for creative work

### [Graff’s Turf](https://graffsturf.com) — Fort Morgan, CO

#### Office Operations and Leadership (March 2022–January 2023)

* One of our goals was to stabilize the core of the business, with a goal to grow from 2 stores to 50 stores over the next several years. Most of my work was driven by this premise.

* As a hiring manager, rebooted the interview process with a much higher focus on identifying candidates with greater competency, who _think like an owner_, and have a bias toward taking action. The goal was to develop a high-quality, reliable team who could help elevate us to the next level. Through trial and error, we were able to learn how to interview better, discover what worked well and what didn't work well, and use that to improve the next set of interviews.

* Began the process of documenting our company processes and procedures for the first time in the company’s 50-year existence. This allowed us to bring more rigor and repeatability to tasks, cross-train the team on how to perform tasks (so that the task was not limited to a single individual with knowledge), and speed-up new hire onboarding.

* Established weekly meetings between between the staff and leadership. This led to increased transparency and improved communication throughout the organization. It also resulted in faster feedback cycles both up the org chart to leadership, as well as down the org chart to staff.

* Implemented regular reviews where expectations could be set/updated on a regular basis, staff could better understand what to expect (and what was expected of them), and everybody was able to benefit from fewer surprises.

* Worked as a liason between leadership and the installation crew to improve an installation technique. Besides needing to persuade upper-management, this involved communicating between different roles in the organization, managing expectations, encouraging people to grow beyond their comfort zones, and ensuring that the change in process was successful.

* Was able to persuade upper-management to adopt _Google Apps for Work_. This allowed sales reps and other off-site workers to receive messages and share information without being tied to a desk at the office. Implementing shared calendars helped us improve how scheduled information was shared across the team, and adopting _Google Docs_ and _Google Sheets_ helped us reduce confusion from emailing documents back and forth. As part of this effort, was responsible for all documentation and training of all staff.

* Helped select and establish a new CRM with better integration into our other systems, reducing the amount of manual work that needed to be performed. Took the initiative to dive deeply into the software so that I could document the tasks and train the rest of the team.

* Kickstarted the effort to step-up our web and social media presence. Worked with leadership to understand what would be needed in order to build enough business to warrant the 50-store goal, identifying good things, bad things, and things we weren't yet doing. Educated leadership on corporate branding, lifestyle branding, voice, fundamentals of SEO, and more. Took over social media posts for about 6 weeks to set the tone and guide the work, before handing-off to a marketing firm. During those 6 weeks we saw a 375% increase in posts, 106% increase in visits to our Facebook page, and a 48.5% increase in page likes.

* Developed the sample package that is now used for maintenance plans on synthetic turf. Maintenance plans are now an integral part of upselling as a way to drive additional revenue.

### Red Moon Resale — Online

#### Owner (May 2021–March 2022)

* Researching brands; hot/cold
* Where to find inventory
* Buy low, sell high
* Posting for sale; photography
* Selling on online sales platforms

### [Bark King Blower Truck Service](https://barkking.com) — Woodinville, WA

#### Office Manager (January 2019—April 2021)

* Improved the interview process to have fewer false-positives. Adopted revisions to the employee manual, insurance manuals, and training guides. Collaborated with the HR company to ensure legal compliance. Invested in ensuring employees were engaged, happy, and productive. Wanted to implement safety meetings, checked equipment, and ensure proper outfitting for the job (e.g., raingear, high-visibility vests).

* Saved money through price comparisons and negotiating with vendors over prices.

* There was active resistance to digital solutions. While many of these were unimplemented, she proposed meaningful improvements to productivity by:

  * Moving the job schedules into a shared, digital calendar that was reviewable by everyone.

  * Moving documents and spreadsheets into a modern office-document solution like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365.

  * Speeding up the ability to pay by migrating from paper invoices being snail-mailed to customers, over to web-based invoicing.

  * Adopting a CRM would have made it easier to divide the work and respond to customer requests in a more timely manner.

  * Migrating from hand-written orders to computer-based entry.

* Wanted to explore having a professional-grade online presence, presence at trade shows, email marketing, coupons.

* Wanted to receive training for the office tasks that the owner "owned". Wanted to increase the cross-training, and follow the [Kanban] style of working together against a shared queue of tasks.

* Transparent communication with employees is vital to smooth operations; paying attention to customer touchpoints; poor customer communication and a lack of timeliness leads to lost business and customer distrust; better delegation can make the office more efficient; learned that an inability to adapt, thinking small, having a big ego, and micromanagement will actively prevent the success of your business.

### [Thermo Tech Coatings](http://www.thermotechcoatings.com) — Monroe, WA

#### Office Manager (November 2018–January 2019)

* Managed the office + production floor + 15 employees. Worked with powder vendors to become knowledgable enough to train. Scheduled training seminars to perform demos and teach techniques.

* After a warehouse fire, scheduled fire department inspections to ensure we were up-to-code and had appropriate safety equipment. Took the initiative to address production issues, assigned tasks, performed quality control and training on-the-fly. Met deadlines in a "powder keg" environment and was able to handle the stress of the production floor.

* Took over responsibilities for customer callbacks, qualifying customers and pre-sales leads. Managed the in-house ordering system, the order forms/processes, invoicing, and account reconciliation.

* Employees look up to the people in charge. Operating with transparency and without ego is key to happy/trusting teams.

### [Synthetic Turf Northwest](https://www.syntheticturfnorthwest.com) — Monroe, WA

#### Office Manager (February 2017–November 2018)

* Adopted the [Lean] methodology (including [Kanban]) to eliminate waste and increase organization and efficiency. Performed the intitial inventory of all items and designed a process to keep track of where inventory was used. Optimized the re-order workflow. Inventory management was required across multiple locations. Negotiated with vendors for better pricing.

* Worked with logistics companies to ensure on-time deliveries; performed quality control to ensure customer satisfaction; materials were project-specific. Ensured that the team always had the correct materials on-hand for jobs, and avoided tying-up unsellable inventory. Sold leftover scrap materials online. Operated the turf cutter so that the team could cut-to-spec.

* Vendor events: Performed cost analysis, booth design and supplies, and scheduling the booth team/equipment. A $2,500-5,000 event generated 50 leads (avg). Roughly 20 were qualified leads @ $5,000+ per job (= $100,000 at the low end). Up-sold additional products and services.

* Completed a full CRM implementation. Managed the sales funnel from the website, and engaged with customers to qualify the leads. Aligned with owner's vision for online leads, filter of hot/cold leads, and setting-up consultation appointments.

* Participated in "360-degree" performance reviews (self-review, manager review, peer review). Review feedback was well-rounded and multi-directional.

* Learned that Kanban doesn't work if there's no accountability/reinforcement; learned the importance of a good workflow; learned the value of self-reflection and understanding your personal strengths/weaknesses; learned that team morale is critical (e.g., team outings); learned the value of earning the trust of your peers (e.g., we all rise and fall together).

### Blazing Gypsy Boutique — Online

#### Owner, Direct Sales (July 2016–January 2019)

Jessika opened an online retail clothing store for the first time. Even though the business ultimately failed, she was able to gain insight and experience as a result that is difficult to learn in other contexts.

* Vetted and brought-on vendors; vetted and tested products before selling them; learned the value of building trust with customer relationships; learned how to run a small business end-to-end; learned how to separate personal finances from business funds.

* Explored a variety of approaches to marketing and social media presence via trial and error; managed multiple social media channels with automation; kept customers engaged via email marketing, trade show and vendor events, and _Facebook Live_ video streaming.

* Learned about the cyclical nature of online sales; adapted inventory control to keep the right amount of the right products on-hand; reduced the off-season products to free-up cash to reinvest; adapted to identifying product 2–3 seasons ahead; over a long enough timeline, was able to see trends about what sells best during different parts of the year. Learned how to analyze sales numbers to understand costs, revenue, and profits.

* Learned humility by discovering several approaches that didn't work; learned how to manage and prioritize time while balancing the needs of the business, family, and herself; learned not to employ your friends; persevered when the work got hard and managed to build a business with decent revenue for its size; at the same time, understanding the sales projections helped her understand when it became the right time to close shop. (You need to know when to quit so that you can shift your efforts to something more effective.)

* When you have a product you're passionate about, it's easy and fun to sell; Jessika learned a lot from the many new people she met as a result; gained many personal and professional contacts/connections; the business opened doors to other opportunities.
