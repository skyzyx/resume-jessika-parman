Evans, CO</p>
<p><strong>Experienced office manager with a focus on improving
efficiency by embracing technology.</strong></p>
<h2 id="summaryobjective">Summary/Objective</h2>
<p>Jessika is not <em>yet-another-cog-in-the-machine</em>. She is a
leader who brings new ideas to the table, challenges the status quo, and
seeks to make every working environment better. Conversely, if you're
looking for someone to sit, do precisely the thing, and then stop and
wait for futher instructions — this probably won't be a good fit for
anyone.</p>
<p>Jessika is truly a <em>Jill-of-all-trades</em>. Her strength comes
from not being trapped in the box of having one, specific,
narrowly-defined role. Instead, being <em>encouraged</em> to bring
business value, efficiency, and improvements <em>across</em> the
business is a role where Jessika will thrive. She is looking for a role
where creative problem-solving is encouraged, not frowned-upon. She
seeks to work with a team that <em>wants</em> to improve, <em>wants</em>
to grow, and is receptive to new ideas. She is intrinsically motivated,
thinks like an owner, delivers on commitments, and always desires to
deliver the best possible experience for customers. She isn’t
constrained by <a

things have always been done</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of work, Jessika lives in northern Colorado with her husband,
two children, and three dogs. She loves travel and is an amateur
photographer.</p>

Operations and Leadership (March 2022–January 2023)</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>One of our goals was to stabilize the core of the business, with
a goal to grow from 2 stores to 50 stores over the next several years.
Most of my work was driven by this premise.</p></li>
<li><p>Rebooted the interview process with a much higher focus on
identifying candidates with greater competency, who <em>think like an
owner</em>, and have a bias toward taking action.</p></li>
<li><p>Began the process of documenting our company processes and
procedures for the first time in the company’s 50-year existence. This
allowed us to bring more rigor and repeatability to tasks, cross-train
the team on how to perform tasks, and speed-up new hire
onboarding.</p></li>
<li><p>Established weekly meetings between between the staff and
leadership, to increase transparency and improved communication
throughout the organization.</p></li>
<li><p>Coordinated between leadership and the installation crew. This
involved communicating between different roles in the organization,
managing expectations, encouraging people to grow beyond their comfort
zones, and ensuring that the change in process was successful.</p></li>
<li><p>Adopted <em>Google Workspaces</em>, allowing sales reps and other
off-site workers to share information without being tied to a desk.
Responsible for all documentation and training of all staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Helped select and establish a CRM with better integration into
our other systems, reducing manual work. Took the initiative to dive
deeply so that I could document the tasks and train the rest of the
team.</p></li>
<li><p>Stepped-up our web and social media presence. Took over social
media posts for about 6 weeks to set the tone and guide the work, before
handing-off to a marketing firm. During those 6 weeks we saw a 375%
increase in posts, 106% increase in visits to our Facebook page, and a
48.5% increase in page likes.</p></li>
<li><p>Developed the sample package that is now used for maintenance
plans on synthetic turf. Maintenance plans are now an integral part of
upselling as a way to drive additional revenue.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved the interview process to have fewer false-positives.
Adopted revisions to the employee manual, insurance manuals, and
training guides. Collaborated with the HR company to ensure legal
compliance.</p></li>
<li><p>Saved money through price comparisons and negotiating with
vendors over prices.</p></li>
<li><p>There was active resistance to digital solutions and
modernization of business practices. While many of these were
unimplemented, Jessika proposed meaningful improvements to productivity
by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving the job schedules into a shared, digital calendar that was
reviewable by everyone.</li>
<li>Moving documents and spreadsheets into a modern office-document
solution like Google Docs or Microsoft Office 365.</li>
<li>Speeding up the ability to pay by migrating from paper invoices
being snail-mailed to customers, over to web-based invoicing.</li>
<li>Adopting a CRM would have made it easier to divide the work and
respond to customer requests in a more timely manner.</li>
<li>Migrating from hand-written orders to computer-based entry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Learned that transparent communication with employees is vital;
paying attention to customer touchpoints makes a huge difference; poor
customer communication and a lack of timeliness leads to lost business
and customer distrust; better delegation can make an office more
efficient; learned that an inability to adapt, and micromanagement, will
actively prevent the success of your business.</p></li>
