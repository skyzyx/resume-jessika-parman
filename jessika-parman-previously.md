### Blazing Gypsy Boutique — Online

#### Owner, Direct Sales (July 2016–January 2019)

Jessika opened an online retail clothing store for the first time. Even though the business ultimately failed, she was able to gain insight and experience as a result that is difficult to learn in other contexts.

When you have a product you're passionate about, it's easy and fun to sell; Jessika learned a lot from the many new people she met as a result; gained many personal and professional contacts/connections; the business opened doors to other opportunities.
